# MotionTrackingFan
This was a small project implementing two PIR motion sensor modules to track a user within two zones. This was created to experiment with a Texas Instruments MSP430 Microcontroller and the C language. The focus for this project was software, including how to implement interrupts and other firmware level best practices.
